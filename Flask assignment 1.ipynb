    "   - Flask is a micro web framework for Python. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It provides the essentials for building web applications and leaves many decisions to the developer.\n",
    "   - Advantages of Flask:\n",
    "     - Lightweight: Simple and easy to learn with minimal built-in features.\n",
    "     - Extensible: You can add extensions for various functionalities as needed.\n",
    "     - Flexible: Allows you to choose components and libraries for your project.\n",
    "     - Good for small to medium-sized applications.\n",

    "Q2. To create a simple Flask application displaying \"Hello World!!\" in Jupyter Notebook, please see the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from flask import Flask\n",
    "   app = Flask(__name)\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - App routing in Flask is the process of defining URL patterns and associating them with view functions. It is used to map HTTP requests to specific functions or views in your Flask application.\n",
    "   - App routes are used to define the behavior of your application when a specific URL is accessed. They determine which function should handle the request and generate the appropriate response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. To create \"/welcome\" and \"/\" routes in Flask:\n",
    "\n",

    "Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write Python code to demonstrate the working of the url_for() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `url_for()` function in Flask is used for URL building. It generates URLs for routes based on their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example code to demonstrate `url_for()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "   app = Flask(__name)\n",
    "\n",
    "   @app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
    "   def show_user_profile(username):\n",
