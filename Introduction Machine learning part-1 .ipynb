    "Q6: What is train-test-validation split, and what is the importance of each term?\n",
    "\n",
    "Train Data: The training dataset is used to train the machine learning model. It contains a large portion of the available data, including input features and their corresponding target labels (in supervised learning). The model learns patterns and relationships in the data from the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Data: The test dataset is a separate portion of the data that the model has never seen during training. It is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Testing helps assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen examples and provides an estimate of its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Data: The validation dataset is used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. It helps monitor the model's performance on data that it hasn't been directly trained on. By adjusting hyperparameters based on validation performance, you can optimize the model's generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each term:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data is crucial because it's where the model learns from and builds its internal representations.\n",
    "Test data is essential for assessing how well the model performs on unseen data and whether it generalizes well.\n",
    "Validation data is used for fine-tuning the model's parameters and avoiding overfitting, ensuring that the model is not merely memorizing the training data but learning patterns that can apply to new data.\n",

    "**Q7- How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by training a model on normal data and then using that model to identify data points that are different from the normal data. This is done by learning the underlying distribution of the normal data and then flagging any data points that fall outside of that distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common way to do this is to use a dimensionality reduction technique, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This makes it easier to learn the distribution of the data and to identify anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common approach is to use a clustering algorithm to group the data into different clusters. Anomalies are then identified as data points that do not belong to any of the clusters.\n",
