    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to run multiple tasks simultaneously. This is especially beneficial for computationally expensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased responsiveness: Multithreading can make a program more responsive by allowing it to continue to be responsive while computationally expensive tasks are running.\n",
    "Simplified code: Multithreading can simplify code by making it easier to write code that is concurrent and parallel.\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity: Multithreading can increase the complexity of a program, as it requires the programmer to think about how to synchronize threads and avoid race conditions.\n",
    "Increased debugging difficulty: Multithreaded programs can be more difficult to debug than single-threaded programs, as the programmer needs to consider the possibility of race conditions and other concurrency-related problems.\n",
    "Reduced performance on some systems: Multithreading can reduce performance on some systems, such as systems with a single CPU.\n",
    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock: A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to finish executing, and neither thread can finish executing because it is waiting for the other thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race condition: A race condition is a situation where two or more threads are accessing the same data at the same time, and the outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions can be difficult to detect and debug, and they can lead to unpredictable and unexpected behavior in a program."
