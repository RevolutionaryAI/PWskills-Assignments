    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table.\n",

    "Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity and to ensure that each row in a table is unique. Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the customers table might have a primary key column called id. The orders table might have a foreign key column called customer_id that references the id column in the customers table. This relationship indicates that each order in the orders table belongs to a customer in the customers table.\n",
